# MIDIUSBHOST Library for arduino-esp32

This library allows an esp32 board with USB capabilities to act as a MIDI instrument over USB Host. 
The library is based on arduino-esp32. 

This library support [Arduino MIDI Library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library) in combination with [Arduino USB-MIDI Transport(multi-cable-support branch on my forked version)](https://github.com/aselectroworks/Arduino-USBMIDI/tree/multi-cable-support)
Example using Arduino MIDI Library is [Basic_IO_MIDIHOST_ESP32.ino](https://github.com/aselectroworks/Arduino-USBMIDI/blob/multi-cable-support/examples/Basic_IO_MIDIHOST_ESP32/Basic_IO_MIDIHOST_ESP32.ino)
